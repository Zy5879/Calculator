# Calculator

This Calculator takes in 2 pairs of numbers and solves them depending
on the operation that is choosen. I decided to build this in order to practice
my understanding of everything I have been learning about JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
DOM MANIPULATION, IF STATEMENTS, FUNCTIONS, STRING METHODS, ADDEVENTLISTENERS AND MUCH MORE.
